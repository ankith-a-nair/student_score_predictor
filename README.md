The **Student Score Predictor** is a beginner-friendly Python project that predicts a student's score based on input features such as study hours. It demonstrates the basics of **machine learning**, including data preprocessing, model training, and prediction. This project is ideal for students and beginners learning AI/ML concepts.

-> Features
- Predicts student scores based on input features (study hours, attendance, etc.)
- Interactive console interface for easy use
- Demonstrates basic machine learning workflow
- Suitable for beginners to understand regression models

-> Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-score-predictor.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd student-score-predictor

3.Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


-> If requirements.txt is not available, install manually:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

-> Usage- 
1.Open the project in VS Code or any Python IDE.
2.Run the main Python file:
3.python main.py


Enter the required input values when prompted (e.g., number of study hours).

The program outputs the predicted student score.

Sample Dataset
Hours of Study	Score
2	20
4	40
6	60
8	80
10	100

You can add more data to data/students.csv to improve prediction accuracy.
